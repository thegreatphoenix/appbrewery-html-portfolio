<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> I am an internal medicine physician. I have been practising for 11 years now. In th emedical field, computers have become 
  ubiquitious in our day to day lives. Infact, as physicians, we spend more time in front of screens than infront of patients. 
  I realize the improtance of understanding and using computers to our advantage to make our day to day lives easier. As a 
  result, I started taking interest and learning about computers. Also, I have young children. I want to be competent in my 
  computer skills so that I can teach them about computer use from an early age. It is amazing how quickly the information age
  is advancing. New technologies are advancing at an alarming rate. It became imperative that I learn coding and app 
  development so that I can work on executing some of my ideas on my own. I started working on my web application development 
  skills. This is the earliest product I have created from my learnings.</p>

<p>I still remember the day I graduated and started working as a physician. It was a nerve wracking experience. I knew that
  I had adequate knowledge to practice. I had good training. I was still nervous to make decisions. The thought of having 
  someone's health and well-being in your hands provoked extreme anxiety. Also, there is so much gray in the practice of 
  medicine. Although medicine has advanced leaps and bounds from a century ago, there are a lot of points in internal
  medicine where there is not clear evidence yet. the practic eof medicine is as much an artform as it is a science. As I 
  gained experience caring for more patients through the years, I grew in confidence. This is what 10-years of practice does, 
  There are still things to learn and explore but I am much ore comfortable working as a physician compared to when I started 
  10-years prior. As I embark on this new journey to learn a new field, I feel the same anxiety I felt when I started
  my medical practice. I realize I will need the knowledge and then the practice to become comfortable as a web app developer.</p>

<p>The journey begins....</p>
